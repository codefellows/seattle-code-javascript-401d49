Whiteboard Tips and Advice

- Raphael: read "it" (problem domain) read "it" again break it down into easy manageable pieces
- Camilla: problem domain clarity:  ASK QUESTIONS about the problem domain.  clarify input and output.  (once you ask ??? - write. it. down.  take notes).  I rely on the visual to help me write the algorithm and then I rely on the algorithm to help me write the code
- Julian: get good at visualizing the problem!  
  1. show the interviewer that you understand the problem.
  2. show the approach, finding your path to a solution.  make notes enlist interviewer to get help you need.  make a list of the step by step process ESPECIALLY if help is given or interviewer clarifies anything fuzzy.
- Lewis:  REACT 
  - R: repeat problem domain
  - E: get examples to understand
  - A: Approach - visualization and algorithm
  - C: code!
  - T: testing and time space
- Kenny:   verbalize your thought process!  DISPLAY KNOWLEDGE
- input/output:  to be mindful of data types and data structures 
- test cases / questions / edge cases:  happy path, any oddities, validation
- use bullets (step by step process) order matters!  
- ask interviewer if any ??? about your approach

## Useful Expo / React Native Tips

- machine and device must be using the SAME wifi  (unless you use `--tunnel`)
- Last Class:  Running windows 11 and iOS on my phone. in terminal, needed to run `expo start --tunnel`.  Maybe try this if the app doesn't initially open on your phone!
- switch to node 16, 18 not supported for all - mixed results noted
- `npx epo start --tunnel` if you want to collaborate, or sometimes just to get it to work!
