## Whiteboard

[Today's Freehand](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/jChqJ6ayQ)

## Code Review

- Raphael: created lots of handlers, how does that wire up
- Lewis: generated data could not be tested easily

# Socket.io

> Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed. Socket.IO is built on top of the WebSockets API (Client side) and Node.js. It is one of the most depended upon library on npm (Node Package Manager).
