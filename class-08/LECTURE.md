## RBAC

> Access is granted based on the role you have been assigned.  user might be able to read.  a writer might be able to read and create, an editor might be able to read, create, and update.  and admin might be able to do full crud: create, read, update, and delete.

- Hunter: payroll admin access example.  admins have more access than a new employee
- Trace:  continuing above thought... employee has only access to their payroll
- Raphael: Capability based on your role, if no rbac then whoever has access to everything
- Camilla: to maintain most sites meaningful, we need an admin layer
